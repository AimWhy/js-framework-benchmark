Please observe the following rules:

If I ask you to merge a PR by giving you the PR number, perform the following tasks:
1. If not yet running start a ssh agent via "eval `ssh-agent`
ssh-add /home/stefan/.ssh/id_ed25519_github_hetzner"
2. Check that no branch `merge-pr-{number}` exists. If it does forcible delete that branch. Create a new branch using the naming convention `merge-pr-{number}`
3. Check out the PR into that branch
4. Check if the PR looks valid. Use `gh pr diff {PR-number} --name-only` to get the list of changed files in the PR. Changes in the PR must only concern subfolders of frameworks and no other directory. Always print the result of that check.
5. You must compute a list of folders that are affected by the PR. Can be a single folder or can be many folders. Example: If the files "package.json" and "package-lock.json" in frameworks/keyed/angular and "package.json" in "frameworks/non-keyed/react" are changed the list is "keyed/angular non-keyed/react", so you leave out the frameworks directory and only report the directory names. This list in the argument for the next step.
Always print the list.
Check if there are changed to files in the webdriver-ts folder (e.g. webdriver-ts/results.json). If so make sure to eliminate those changes by using `git checkout` to restore the original versions such they don't end in the main branch when merging.
6. If for each changed directory both package.json and package-lock.json are changed in the PR you must use `npm run rebuild-ci {list of framework-paths}`. Otherwise you must use `npm run rebuild {list of framework-path}` otherwise. You must concatenate all the directories with changes (which you computed above) in a format like "keyed/angular non-keyed/react"
    Just to explain: "npm run rebuild" must be used when the package-lock.json should be regenerated by
    npm install. "npm run rebuild-ci" can only be called when npm ci works and package.json and package-lock.json are in sync.
7. if the npm command above reported "======> Please rerun the benchmark:" then the PR can be merged.
    * Check first if some file must be added to git and commit it. You can ignore all untracked files.
    * Merge the PR using merge commits as the merge strategy
8. Delete the branch after merging

Rules:
* Never push automatically to the remote
* If you run into an error, stop executing and report the error
